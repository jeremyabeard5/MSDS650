    "##**V. Conclusion**\n",
    "The histograms above support our conclusion for the comparison of the means and std. Airport CNY has a smaller spread in their delayed arrival at the destination ariport than GST does. However, the bulk of the delays for both airports are really small.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "I really enjoyed all the data cleanup practice that this assignment called for. i learned two new commands in my data cleanup efforts: unstack() to create a new dataframe that represents a pivot table of specified columns and reset_index() in order to reset the index of a dataframe to a specific column.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the analysis required a working knowledge of the flight industry, such as determining that a normal distribution for delayed flights would not be normal."
