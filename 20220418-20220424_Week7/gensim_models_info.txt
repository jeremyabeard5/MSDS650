Visualizing the Topics
pyLDAvis produces an interactive visual of your topic model. A good topic model will have equal sized, non-overlapping, bubbles evenly scattered throughout the chart.

This chart is interactive and will change as you mouse-over various objects (bubbles, word list, etc) in the graph.

Each bubble represents a topic. The larger the bubble, the higher percentage of of news articles represented by the topic.
Blue bars represent the overall frequency of each word in the corpus. If no topic is selected, the blue bars of the most frequently used words will be displayed.
Red bars give the estimated number of times a given term was generated by a given topic.
The further the bubbles are away from each other, the more different they are.
