To compute these basic statistics, I filtered the data by only delayed arrival times, and then used the describe() function."

    "This was a difficult comparison! All 3 of these airports have a high number of delays. Atlanta had the lowest proportion of actual delayed arrivals, while Denver had the lowest probability of delayed arrivals. Atlanta also had the lowest average time delay per delayed flight. Given all of the above, I definitely would not choose the Chicago airport. Between Denver and Atlanta however, I think I would choose the Atlanta airport because I trust the proportion more, the actual data, and Atlanta has the lowest proportion of delayed arrivals. \n",

    "# V. Conclusion\n",
    "This assignment was interesting as it dealt with real airport data! My parents fly a lot so I shared some of the findings from here with them. They were really interested at seeing the dataset, and weren't surprised at all to see some of those airports as the most delayed. I was a bit confused at exactly what the Bernoulli's equation probabilities were telling me as the probabilities found using the equation were extremely low. This didn't seem realistic, but then I thought that finding the probability of a precise percentage of flights delayed may be a very low probability indeed. Thank you! Please let me know if you have any questions.\n",
