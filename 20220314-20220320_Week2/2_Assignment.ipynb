    "* Load your choice of dataset (either flights.csv **OR** flights_clean.csv)\n",
    "   - If you are going to clean the dataset yourself, here are some hints:\n",
    "      * Warning!! You are going to need some of the rows/columns with missing values, so don't just throw them away while creating your dataframe\n",
    "      * The column 'ARRIVAL_DELAY' tells you the number of minutes the flight actually arrived verses the scheduled arrival. There are a fair number of missing values for this column, impute (see Demo_Imputing_Data for ideas) this column. Document your approach!\n",
    "      * Hint: A negative number means the flight arrived early.\n",
    "      * Hint: What other columns might you use to fill in this missing data.\n",
    "   - If you are going to start with cleaned_dataset, I encourage you to look at what I did to clean up this data. It will help you going forward   \n",

    "    1) Determine the originaing airport with the largest proportion of flights arriving late to their destination. Do the same for the airport with the smallest proportion. \n",
    "    2) What is the probablity a flight leaving from a given airport will arrive at its destination late?  \n",
    "        * Hint: Calculate the probablity of late arrival at destination for each originating airport.\n",
    "    3) What is the mean and std of late arrival times for both of these airports.\n",
    "        * Based on the mean and std information ONLY, which airport seems like a better choice?\n",
    "    4) Define a question that would utilize Bernoulli's Equation and preform a calculation to support your question.\n",
    "    5) Provide a summary of all the values that you calculated for 3 airports\n",
    "        * Compare the three to each other.\n",
    "        * Which airport would you prefer to fly out of based on your results.\n",
