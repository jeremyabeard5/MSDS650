Week 2: Probability and Proportion
	Proportion: percentage of a larger group

	"A market research firm conducts surveys with a 40% historical response rate. What is the probability that in a new sample of 400 telephone numbers, at least 150 people respond? In other words, what is probability of proportion being 0.375"
		P (probability proportion) = 0.4
		Probability of failure = 1 - P = 0.6
		We need to assume this follows a normal distribution
			To do that we need to make sure:
				np > 5, n(1-p) > 5
					In our case, np = 0.4n, n(1-p) = 0.6n
					n = sample size = 400
					np = 40, n(1-p)=60
					SO we can assume normal distro
		Assuming normal distro
			population mean = 0.4
			To standardize using proportions, we use:
				z = (p_hat - p) / SQRT(p*(1-p)/n)
					p_hat = sample mean = 0.375
					p = population mean = 0.4
					n = sample size = 400
				Z = -1.02
				Now we use standard normal distribution table 
					Where does 0.375 fall on the normal distro table
						Well, it lies at -1.02
				Standard normal distro has mean at 0
					our 0.375 falls at -1.02
					we want to find the area greater than -1.02
				Using table, we get 0.1539
					this is area that falls to the left of -1.02
					so we want 1-0.1539 = 0.8461

	"Suppose 15% of a population of 1750 students say they're experiencing high levels of stress. What is the probability that more than 10% of a sample of 160 would report they are experience high stress levels?"
	p = population mean = 0.15
	p_hat = sample mean = 0.10
	n = sample size = 160
		Need to figure out if we can assume normal distro
			np = 160 * 0.15 = 24, n(1-p) = 160 * 0.85 = 136
				both are greater than 5 (this video says 10 actually), so we can assume normal distro
		Assuming normal distro,
			Z = (p_hat - p) / SQRT(p*(1-p)*n)
			Z = (0.10 - 0.15) / SQRT(0.15*0.85/160) = -0.05/0.02822897 = -1.77122977
			Using tables, P(-1.7712)= 0.03836
			P(>-1.7712) = 1 - 0.03836 = 0.96164 = 96.164%, OPTION C IS ANSWER 
						
	Probability vs. Proportion
		Ex. 1: Flipping a Coin
			Probability(heads) = 50%
			If we flip a coin 50 times and it lands on head 30 times, then Proportion(heads) = 60%
			Probability = theoretical
			Proportion = empirical, real
		Ex. 2: Rolling Dice
			Probability = 1/6 = 16.67%
			Proportion = number of times it actually lands on (dice number)
		Probability talks about the chances of some event happening in the future.
		Proportion describes how often some event actually happened in the past.
	Probabilities
		Joint probability: Probability of two or more events happening at the same time.
		Marginal probability: Probability of an event regardless of other variables outcome.
		Conditional probability: Probability of an event occurring along with one or more other events.
		1-P(A) = "complement"
